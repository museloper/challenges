2.  What happens if we run this code in JS:

    ```javascript
    ["hello"] + { hi: 1 };
    ```

3.  What is a runtime error?

4.  What is Typescript compiled to?

5.  Is this valid Typescript code?

    ```javascript
    const kimchi = {
      맛있어: true,
    };
    ```

6.  We always have to specify a type for our variables in Typescript.

7.  How do we set the type of a variable explicitly in TS?
